# Practice Interviews

This repo has been created to support the #practive-interviews channel on the Gophers slack group. The purpose of this repo is to create a community that can share their practice interview answers and receive feedback. 

A new "challenge" will be set every week, on a Thursday, and then participants will push their "answers" ready to discuss with the wider community. 

If you would like to be involved, please join the slack channel. 

## Groud Rules

- Every week someone sets a task. Ideally this will be someone new, but if there is a limited number of people getting involved, then it can be done on a rotation basis. 

- The task can be anything the person wants (whiteboarding challenge, coding challenge etc) so long as it can be done using free to use software, and can be shared for discussion.

- Each challenge should be kept to a maximum of 2 hours effort. People don't want to give up their lives doing a different challenge every week. 

- Once everybody has done the challenge, they will all be pushed to this Github repository, to the folder created specifically for that week.

- If anybody gets stuck on the challenge, they can obviously ask for help from other participants, but challenges should not be shared on the repository until the time frame has elapsed.
